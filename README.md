# About this project
This is a weather app that allows users to check the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a specified city. The application fetches weather data from the Weatherbit API and provides a responsive interface for displaying the information. The Weatherbit API has a daily limit of 50 calls. If this limit is reached or if there are other issues with data retrieval, the UI is updated with an error message.

This project uses the fetch API for asynchronous data fetching, and the code is written using modern JavaScript features (Object and Array destructuring, Async/Await, template literals, arrow functions). It also incorporates error handling mechanisms.
